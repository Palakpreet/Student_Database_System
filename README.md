# Student_Database_System
This is a console-based Student Database Management System written in C. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. The program calculates CPU time used and memory consumption during its execution. The data will remain stored in the created file in the same directory as default in binary form. The memory is not required to allocate dynamically each time create or add operation is executed.

Features

View all data inserted: Display all the student records stored in the database.
Search for a particular student: Search for a student using their student ID and display their details.
Delete data of a particular student: Delete a student's record using their student ID.
CPU Time and Memory Usage: The program calculates and displays the CPU time used and memory consumed during execution.
